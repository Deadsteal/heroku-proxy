A really simple node.js round-robin proxy meant to run on Heroku to load balance AWS elastic search instances.

To configure, make sure the ELASTIC_SEARCH_SERVERS is set:
ELASTIC_SEARCH_SERVERS="SOME.IP.ADDRESS.compute-1.amazonaws.com,ANOTHER.IP.ADDRESS.compute-1.amazonaws.com"

To run locally:
ELASTIC_SEARCH_SERVERS="SOME.IP.ADDRESS.compute-1.amazonaws.com,ANOTHER.IP.ADDRESS.compute-1.amazonaws.com" node server.js 


Todo
Remove a dead server from the pool
